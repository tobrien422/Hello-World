Hello Humanity! 

I'm here today to give coding and programming a shot. I've been looking to break into a new line of work and coding is something that has really caught my eye. Looking forward to learning as much as i can thoughout as well as working on projects with those of this community. Thank you and have a wonderful morning/day/evening/night.
